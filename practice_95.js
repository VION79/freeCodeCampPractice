/* Problem
Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate 
a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number 
that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.

The lowest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your minimum number, myMin.
The highest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your maximum number, myMax.

// Setup
function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
    // Only change code below this line
    
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;
    // Only change code above this line
  }

// console.log(randomRange(5,16));  or I can code like below.

var random = randomRange(5,16);

console.log(random);
